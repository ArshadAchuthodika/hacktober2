# hactober2




## CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE ISN’T JUST FOR TECHNICAL FOLKS WHO WANT TO WRITE CODE. THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO USE YOUR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IN SUPPORT OF OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS. THIS YEAR, WE’RE MAKING A POINT TO ENCOURAGE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT REQUIRE SOME TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE OR NONE AT ALL. NO MATTER YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN HACKTOBERFEST!
